🛒 Customer Purchase Prediction (ML)
📌 Overview

A machine learning classification project that predicts whether a customer will purchase a product based on demographic and behavioral data. The project demonstrates an end-to-end ML workflow from data preprocessing to model evaluation and selection.

🎯 Objective

To train and compare multiple classification models and identify the best-performing model for customer purchase prediction.

🧹 Data Preprocessing

Missing value imputation (median for numerical, most frequent for categorical)

One-hot encoding for categorical variables

Feature scaling using StandardScaler

Stratified train–test split

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis

Purchase outcome distribution

Key feature distributions

Correlation heatmap

Identification of customer behavior patterns

🤖 Models Implemented

Random Forest Classifier

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

📈 Model Evaluation

Models were evaluated using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and Confusion Matrix.

🏆 Final Model

Random Forest was selected as the final model due to its superior performance and robustness.

💡 Key Insights

Behavioral features strongly influence purchase decisions

Ensemble models outperform simpler classifiers

Useful for targeted marketing and customer segmentation

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, Jupyter Notebook

🚀 How to Run

Open the notebook and run all cells (Kernel → Restart & Run All)
